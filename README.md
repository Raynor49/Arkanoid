# Arkanoid
It's a game where the user controls a platform which can move horizontally across the screen in order to bounce a ball into floating bricks to break them.

## MVP

1. Be able to move the platform at the bottom.
2. Bounce the ball to break bricks
3. Background music and sound effects
4. Moving the platform faster should result in a faster moving ball
5. Hit powerups with the ball to get special abilities?

## Technologies and Libraries

I plan on just using Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS
